## Introduction

Ledget was started from frustration with the choice of personal budgeting apps. Almost all had cluttered and confusing user interfaces, only a portion would automatically import data from financial institutions, and many wouldn't offer the simplicity that should come with a great user experience. So, ledget was born to do the job right.
